Create a Smart Menu system where product categories are linked in a logical food-ordering flow.

Logic:

When a main dish is clicked → show a slider with salads below it.

When a salad is clicked first → show a slider with drinks below it.

When a drink is clicked first → show a slider with main dishes below it.

Each slider displays related items as cards with image, name, and “Add to cart” functionality.

The transitions between categories must feel smooth and dynamic, similar to a food ordering app experience (like McDonald’s or KFC mobile UI).

Requirements:

No “Add to cart” button on the main page — it should only appear inside the slider.

The system should automatically know which category to show next based on the selected product type.

Must be fully responsive and user-friendly, focusing on a natural, restaurant-style order flow.
